# Overview

As a software engineer, I aim to improve my data analysis skills and gain experience in working with real-world datasets. This project involves analyzing Olympic medal data from the 1896 to 2014 Olympic Games, with a focus on extracting insights regarding countries' medal counts, athletes' performances, and trends in medal distribution over time. By working on this project, I hope to enhance my proficiency in data processing, visualization, and Python programming.

The dataset being analyzed consists of several CSV files containing information about Olympic medals won in the Summer and Winter Games. This dataset includes details like the year, event, athlete, country, and the type of medal (Gold, Silver, Bronze) won by athletes.

You can access the dataset on Kaggle at the following link:

I developed this software to answer specific questions related to Olympic performance and medal distribution, such as identifying countries with the most gold medals, examining trends in medal counts for a specific country, and discovering which athletes won the most medals in a single Olympics.

# Data Analysis Results

The following questions were addressed in this project:

1. **Which countries have won the most gold medals overall?**  
   - The top 10 countries with the most gold medals were identified, with the USA, Germany, and Russia among the leaders.
   
2. **How has the number of medals won by a specific country (e.g., USA) changed over time?**  
   - The analysis showed trends in the USA's medal counts over different Olympic years, highlighting notable increases or decreases in medal performance.

3. **Which athletes have won the most medals in a single Olympics?**  
   - The analysis identified the athletes who have accumulated the highest number of medals in a single Olympic event.

4. **How are medals distributed between male and female athletes?**  
   - The pie chart displayed the distribution of medals between male and female athletes, showing the overall gender-based performance in Olympic history.

# Development Environment

This project was developed using the following tools and environment:

- **Development Environment**: VS Code
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.13.0
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - `matplotlib`: For generating visualizations (graphs and charts).

# Useful Websites

During the development of this project, the following websites were helpful:

* [Kaggle Olympics Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/henriqueyamahata/olympic-games)
* [Pandas Documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/)
* [Matplotlib Documentation](https://matplotlib.org/stable/contents.html)

# Future Work

Here are some areas for future improvements and additions:

* **Improve Performance**: Optimize the data processing for larger datasets to improve execution speed.
* **Add More Analysis**: Implement more complex analyses, such as predicting future medal counts or analyzing the relationship between GDP and Olympic success.
* **Enhance User Interaction**: Create a user-friendly interface for dynamic input of countries and years for custom analyses.
* **Include More Visualizations**: Add additional visualizations to represent trends in a more detailed and interactive way.
